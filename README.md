# Lead Scoring Case Study
## Problem Statement
X Education, an online course provider for industry professionals, faces a challenge with a low lead conversion rate despite generating a significant number of leads daily. With only around 30% of leads resulting in conversions, the company aims to enhance efficiency by identifying 'Hot Leads'â€”those most likely to become paying customers. The objective is to build a lead scoring model that accurately assigns scores to leads, distinguishing high-conversion probability leads from lower ones. The target is to achieve an 80% lead conversion rate by prioritizing and focusing the sales efforts on leads with higher scores, optimizing the middle-stage lead nurturing process for increased conversions.
## Our Approach
We will be implementing the following steps to understand data, build a linear regression model and evaluate the model:
1. Data Preperation and EDA
    - 1.1 Reading data, Data Cleaning and Data Manipulation
    - 1.2 EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis)
3. Model Building
4. Model Evaluation
## In this Repository
This repository contains the dataset and a jupyter notebook, the notebook explains our approach in depth.\
It also contains 3 pdf files, a summary, presentation and answers to few business questions.
## Outcomes
Performed Exploratory Data Analysis on the dataset.\
Successfully built a Logistic regression model with an accuracy of 81%
